The Abaqus files folder contains numerical models with variable top width and thickness of chamfer. The deflection in vertical axis direction were observed.
.png is a reference chamfered paver block.
.py file is the python code generated based on the relation between topwidth and deflection and also between thickness of chamfer and deflection observed.
